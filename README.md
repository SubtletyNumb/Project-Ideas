_Chatbot App
Description:
Chatbots remain popular because they can accomplish so much. It is like having your own personal helper. One example of a chatbot you could create is one that keeps track of your daily tasks and gives you recommendations on how to improve productivity. So in one use case maybe you spent 3 hours programming and skipped doing laundry on that day because you were too busy. The chatbot could help you to get better at time management and possibly even use pomodoro.

_Job Search Manager App:
Description:
Keeping track of all of the job applications that you do can be so tedious as there are tons of platforms to apply for jobs and it is not easy to keep track of them all. So creating an app where you can keep track of your applications, interviews, as well as feedback would do wonders. Sure you could use a simple spreadsheet but if you really want to be a power user then having a dedicated app would be much better. Plus you could export that data as CSV or json file so that you can do whatever you want with it.
